##Lab 1_ Classification

#Method 1: Tree based classification

step 1: collecting data 

```{r }
getwd()
setwd('C:/Users/Madhu/Side Projects/Machine_Learning_Course')

#Read data file

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
